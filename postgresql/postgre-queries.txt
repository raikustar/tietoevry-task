Made a database in pgAdmin called tietoevry. 

1. Create table
CREATE TABLE transaction (
	transaction_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	customer_id INTEGER,
	value_date DATE NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE,
	amount INTEGER
);


2. Insert into table 
INSERT INTO transaction (customer_id, value_date, amount)
VALUES (2, '31-01-2025', 500);


3. Return cumulative_sum and total_amount
SELECT 
	customer_id, 
	value_date,
	amount,
	SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, EXTRACT(MONTH FROM value_date) ORDER BY value_date, transaction_id) AS cumulative_sum,
	SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS total_amount
FROM 
	transaction
ORDER BY
	customer_id;




Used this article as an example.
Most of my postgresql has come from using it through Java Spring Boot with annotations.
